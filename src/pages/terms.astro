            Before initiating any formal legal proceeding, the parties agree to

          </p>
          <p>
            If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation, it shall be
            resolved through binding arbitration administered in accordance with
            the rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration
            shall take place in Texas, and the arbitrator's decision shall be
            final and binding.

            If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid,
            unenforceable, or illegal by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
