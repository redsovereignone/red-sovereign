  CONTENT STRUCTURE GUIDELINES FOR AEO (AI Engine Optimization)

  1. Open with a standalone summary paragraph (2-3 sentences).
     AI engines often extract the first paragraph as a citation.

  2. Use H2/H3 headings phrased as questions where possible.
     e.g., "## Why does this matter?" not "## Background"

  3. Keep paragraphs to 3-4 sentences max.
     Short paragraphs get cited more often by AI engines.

  4. Bold key facts and statistics.
     AI engines weight bold text as higher-signal content.

  5. Include a "Key Takeaways" section near the top.

  6. End with a "Frequently Asked Questions" section.
     Mirror these in the frontmatter `faqs` array for JSON-LD.

  7. Include source citations with links.
     AI engines prefer content that references primary sources.
