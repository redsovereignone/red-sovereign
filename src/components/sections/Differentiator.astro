          Most AI consultants sell theory. Most dev shops want you dependent on
          them. We're different because we've done this — <strong
            class="text-cream font-semibold"
            >built three companies from scratch, scaled them, and sold them.</strong
          > We understand what it takes to grow a business because we've had to make
          the same decisions you face.
        </p>
        <p>
          We don't hand you a strategy deck and disappear. We build the first
          version with you, train your team to own it, and set up the guardrails
          so you don't need us anymore. <strong class="text-cream font-semibold"
            >Our success means your independence.</strong
          >
        </p>
        <p>
          And we practice what we preach — our own operations run on the same
          AI-native systems we build for clients.
