## Psychological Triggers Applied

### Cialdini's Principles:
1. **Reciprocity**: Free valuable playbook before asking for contact
2. **Commitment**: Small questions build to bigger commitment
3. **Social Proof**: "1,247 founders", "273 playbooks today"
4. **Authority**: Founder with 6 exits, SOC2 compliance
5. **Liking**: Friendly, helpful tone throughout
6. **Scarcity**: "3 spots left", "Limited time offer"

### Fogg Behavior Model (B=MAT):
- **Motivation**: Clear value props, ROI indicators
- **Ability**: Reduced to 5 questions, 60 seconds
- **Triggers**: Multiple CTAs, urgency indicators

### Loss Aversion:
- "Your competitors don't want you to see this"
- "Reserve your spot for 7 days"
- Recovery mechanisms for abandoned sessions

## Copy Improvements

### Before → After Examples:
1. "Get Your Free 90-Day Growth Playbook" → "See Your Revenue Roadmap"
2. "Build Your Growth Playbook" → "Let's 10x Your Pipeline"
3. "Send My Playbook" → "Yes, Send My Growth Plan"
4. "Your playbook is ready!" → "Your $1.2M revenue roadmap is ready"
5. "Book Your Strategy Call" → "Book Your Strategy Call Now (3 spots left)"

## Friction Reduction

### Removed Barriers:
- Progressive disclosure (show value before email)
- Session persistence (can return to incomplete playbooks)
- Visual progress indicators
- Clear time expectations ("60 seconds")
- Multiple entry points (playbook or direct call)

### Added Accelerators:
- Auto-focus on form fields
- Enter key submission
- Smooth animations between steps
- Immediate value display
- Quick-select buttons with hover previews

## Mobile Optimizations
- Touch-friendly button sizes (min 44px)
- Reduced animations on mobile
- Stacked layouts for small screens
- Simplified navigation
- Optimized form inputs

## A/B Test Recommendations

### Priority 1 Tests (High Impact):
1. **Headline Test**: Problem-focused vs Solution-focused vs Outcome-focused
2. **Question Count**: 5 questions vs 3 questions
3. **Email Timing**: Before preview vs After preview
4. **CTA Button Color**: Red gradient vs White vs Green

### Priority 2 Tests (Medium Impact):
1. **Progress Display**: Percentage vs Steps vs Value built
2. **Trust Signals**: Logos vs Testimonials vs Stats
3. **Urgency Type**: Scarcity vs Time-limited vs Social proof
4. **Preview Depth**: Teaser vs Full preview

### Priority 3 Tests (Refinements):
1. **Animation Speed**: Fast vs Medium vs Slow
2. **Modal Size**: Full screen vs Large vs Medium
